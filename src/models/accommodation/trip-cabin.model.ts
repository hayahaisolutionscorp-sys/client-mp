/**
 * Trip-specific information (e.g. passenger capacity) for Cabin
 * We have a separate table/model for this because of the following scenario:
 *
 * Cabin A is a ship that has a recommended passenger capacity of 100
 * Trip A and Trip B both are going to be using Cabin A
 *
 * Passengers boarding Trip A consist of many families with children, while
 * passengers boarding Trip B are mostly adults.
 *
 * Admins figure the recommended passenger capacity of Cabin A will suffice for Trip B,
 * but they think Trip A can still accommodate 20 more passengers.
 *
 * So for Trip A, they increase the passenger capacity of Cabin A.
 * This increase should not affect Trip B. Having a separate table will allow this.
