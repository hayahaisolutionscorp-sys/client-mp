/**
 * We create a separate table instead of an enum for Cabin Type because
 * there is no "standard" list of cabin types that is used by all shipping liners
 * e.g. Aznar has Aircon, Non-Aircon cabin types, but other shipping lines probably
 * have Economy, First Class, or some other combinations.
 * This separation will enable each shipping line to have their own Cabin Type
 *
 * So in Trip Search, filtering by Cabin Type is disabled until the search is
 * filtered by Shipping Line
 * e.g. For Aznar's Aircon, Non-Aircon cabin types to be "selectable" or "filterable",
 * Aznar should be selected in the Shipping Line filter first.
